# Introduction

This project is to built in react and uses firebase as a backend. This is a work in progress and so far i have created the homepage and shop page. I have added user authentication via google sign up and also sign up with email and password. The users are stored in the database and can sign in. The firebase database is called firestore.

The next part of this project will be adding Redux to manage the state so it's easier to scale the application, i will also be adding the shopping cart and the payment gateway which is going to be stripe.
